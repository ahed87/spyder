I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors

scientific computing and software development.

This release represents 14 months of development since version 2.2 and introduces
major enhancements and new features:

   * Python 3 support (versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are supported).
   * Various Editor improvements:
     - Use the Tab key to do code completions
     - Highlight cells
     - First-class support for Enaml files
     - Improve how calltips are shown
   * Better looking Object Inspector
   * Several refinements to the user interface to make it easier and more intuitive

Spyder 2.2 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 400,000 times!)
and we hope 2.3 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 70 important bugs,
merged 30 pull requests from 11 authors and added almost 1000 commits between
these two releases.

Beta release
============

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 fifth public beta release


Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce the fifth beta of our next major version: Spyder 3.0.

We've been working on this version for more than two years now and as far as we know
it's working very well. There are still several bugs to squash but we encourage all
people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try. This beta version is released
seven weeks after our fourth one and it includes almost 100 commits.

Spyder 3.0 comes with several interesting and exciting new features. The most
important ones are:

* Support for much more programming languages: Spyder relies now on the excellent Pygments
  library to provide syntax highlight and suggest code completions in the Editor, for all
  programming languages supported by it.
* A new file switcher: Spyder 3.0 will come with a fancy file switcher, very similar in
  spirit to the one present in Sublime Text. This is a dialog to select among the open
  files in the Editor, by doing a fuzzy search through their names. It also lets users to
  view the list of classes, methods and functions defined in the current file, and select
  one of them. This dialog is activated with `Ctrl+P`.
* A Numpy array graphical builder: Users who need to create NumPy arrays in Spyder for
  matrices and vectors can do it now in a graphical way by pressing `Ctrl+M` in the Editor
  or the Consoles. This will open an empty 2D table widget to be filled with the data
  required by the user.
* A new icon theme based on FontAwesome.
* A new set of default pane layouts for those coming from Rstudio or Matlab (under
  `View > Window layouts`).
* A simpler and more intuitive way to introduce keyboard shortcuts.
* Support for PyQt5, which fixes problems in MacOS X and in high definition screens.

You can easily install this beta if you use Anaconda by running:

    conda update qt pyqt
    conda install -c qttesting qt pyqt
    conda install -c spyder-ide spyder==3.0.0b5

Or you can use pip with this command:

    pip install --pre -U spyder


Enjoy!
